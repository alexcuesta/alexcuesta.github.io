Hi, I'm Alex, a Senior Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience designing, building, and scaling backend systems across startups and enterprise environments, mainly in Java. Iâ€™ve led engineering projects, mentored teams, and improved reliability and observability at companies like New Relic, Hotels.com and Ocado Technology.

I am very passionate about technology and I have always thought twice moving to a more managerial position because I don't want to lose my passion in meetings.
