Hi, I'm Alex, a Senior Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience designing, building, and scaling backend systems across startups and enterprise environments, mainly in Java. I’ve led engineering projects, mentored teams, and improved reliability and observability at companies like New Relic, Hotels.com and Ocado Technology.

I am very passionate about technology and I have always thought twice moving to a more managerial position because I don't want to lose my passion in meetings.

My current interests are **Go language** and **AI/LLM**. 

* Why Go?

 I’ve grown a bit tired of the Java ecosystem. Nowadays, it often feels like we’re programming for Spring rather than the JVM. Spring, while powerful, tends to spoil developers by enforcing an overly opinionated way of building software—often adding unnecessary complexity where simpler, lightweight solutions would suffice.
 
 The Java language itself has also become increasingly convoluted. In its effort to catch up with Kotlin, it’s evolving into a three-headed monster—introducing multiple ways of achieving the same thing, which ultimately makes team development more complicated instead of simplifying it.
 
 Go, on the other hand, feels refreshing in its simplicity. Most of the essential tools come built-in—no need to juggle frameworks, build systems, or plugins like Spring, Maven, or Gradle. It offers a straightforward, pragmatic approach to software development that prioritises clarity and consistency over cleverness.

* Why Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models? 
  
  Although I don’t have time to explore every new technology, I can’t help but feel passionate about innovation — especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models and Generative AI are truly astonishing, and they’ve completely reignited my curiosity.
  
  I now dedicate time to keeping up with new developments, experimenting with different models and agents, and learning how to design more effective prompts. I’ve also been exploring how applications can integrate with LLMs and how their capabilities can be extended through MCP servers.
  
  To put this curiosity into practice, I’ve built a couple of small projects:
  
  * A [https://github.com/alexcuesta/code-review-app](Python-based code review app) powered by Ollama.
  * An [https://github.com/alexcuesta/devcontext](MCP server in Node.js), to understand how tools can be exposed for agent interaction.

Additionally, I completed Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course in 2018, which gave me a solid foundation in the fundamentals of AI.
