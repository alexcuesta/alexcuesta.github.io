Although I don’t have time to explore every new technology, I can’t help but feel passionate about innovation — especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models and Generative AI are truly astonishing, and they’ve completely reignited my curiosity.

I now dedicate time to keeping up with new developments, experimenting with different models and agents, and learning how to design more effective prompts. I’ve also been exploring how applications can integrate with LLMs and how their capabilities can be extended through MCP servers.

To put this curiosity into practice, I’ve built a couple of small projects:

* A [Python-based code review app](https://github.com/alexcuesta/code-review-app) powered by Ollama.
* An [MCP server in Node.js](https://github.com/alexcuesta/devcontext), to understand how tools can be exposed for agent interaction.

Additionally, I completed [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course in 2018](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/KDAEHMZ8P9WR), which gave me a solid foundation in the fundamentals of AI.
