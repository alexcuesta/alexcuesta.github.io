I see that I am using AI tools more and more every day: I use ChatGPT to ask general questions, I use Claude Sonnet as a Code agent, etc. I see that my 20 years of experience in software development in Java is losing value every day. It is easier and faster for me to tell an AI Agent to solve a given problem. The agent can solve complex problems in a few minutes. The same problems would take me much longer: days, sometimes weeks after reading and testing different solutions. 

It is a fact for me that eventually, in the next few years, I won't have to worry about coding intensively. I will have to describe what I want to solve and let the agent code it for me. I think I will have to focus on good prompt engineering and building good and resilient distributed systems. 

That makes me think: is learning a new coding language worth it? Should I focus on learning how to leverage my experience into the new AI era? I have the impression that the number of software engineer positions will be reduced as a consequence of the AI revolution. Is it worth learning or mastering a new language like Go? 

I don't like to say this but I think the answer is: no. It is good to learn a new language but it should not be a priority taking into account what comes ahead in the nearest future.

## This is how ChatGPT pictures the future

**2025-2027 (Short Term)**

- AI tools (e.g., code-generation, testing, review assistants) will become more widely embedded in development workflows.

- Routine coding tasks — especially those that are repeatable, well defined, lower risk — will increasingly be handled (or at least significantly accelerated) by AI. 

- The value of senior engineers who deeply understand architecture, systems design, domain complexity, and non-routine problems will remain high (and may increase). 

- Learning new languages (like Go) still has value but the marginal benefit from just language-switching may shrink as tooling abstracts more of implementation.

- Demand will shift toward engineers who can work with AI, define constraints, review outputs, integrate AI-generated code, ensure safety/quality, and design systems rather than just code them.

**2027-2030 (Medium Term)**

- The distinction between “coding” and “defining” will blur: more emphasis on “what do we want” + “how do we train or direct the system” rather than “write every line”. Some research frames this as “software engineering 3.0” — AI-native engineering. 

- Lower-risk, standardised engineering work may see fewer full-time roles; instead, firms may lean on smaller teams of senior engineers plus more AI-augmented or offshore/flexible junior layer. 

- New roles will emerge: prompt engineering, AI-tool orchestration, model integration, ethical/safety oversight, systems that combine distributed systems + AI components.

- A background in distributed systems, Java/Kotlin, cloud (AWS/GCP) gives a strong baseline to pivot into design/architecture of AI-augmented systems (rather than purely implementation).

**2030+ (Longer Horizon)**

- Many formerly “pure coder” tasks will be automated or semi-automated. The remaining value will be in high-complexity systems: reliability/mission-critical, heavy domain knowledge, strategy, non-routine innovation, human/AI interaction design.

- Engineers who’ve pivoted into designing AI-augmented workflows, infrastructure for AI, and combining domain + tooling + integration will be very valuable.

- Mastery of one more language (like Go) is less important than mastery of engineering thinking: system boundaries, trade-offs, performance, resilience, data flows, AI-model + human interaction, ethics/compliance.


# Conclusion

- I should prioritise Soft Skills and AI Engineering over learning new languages
- I still want to master Go. I think it will play a role in the future when it comes to deploying services or observability tools. It is good to have it under my belt. But it should not be the highest priority.
