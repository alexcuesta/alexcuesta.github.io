title: First post on Github!
---

I have decided to move my blog to github from [alexcuesta.wordpress.com](https://alexcuesta.wordpress.com/).

My previous blog reflects a different stage of my life â€” my years at Hotels.com, my time in London, and the period when I focused exclusively on Java. It also belongs to an era when the industry was primarily concerned with improving software quality and development processes.

Since then, both the industry and my own journey have evolved. Software development has matured tremendously, my life has changed in many ways, and it feels like the right moment to refresh my image and start a new chapter.
