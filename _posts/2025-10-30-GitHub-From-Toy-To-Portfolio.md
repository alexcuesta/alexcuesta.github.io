I created my GitHub account back in 2009, while working at Faculty of 1000 (F1000). Those were formative years — working with brilliant colleagues, learning proper BDD/TDD, mastering Lucene and Groovy on Grails, and discovering what true agile development really meant.

I still remember the day a colleague introduced us to Git and GitHub. We started experimenting with Git, jQuery, and other new toys, and I ended up creating a small side project called [Lost In Twitter](https://github.com/alexcuesta/Lost-In-Twitter)
.

After that, GitHub just sat there quietly. I never really took it seriously — I always kept a clear line between my work and personal life, rarely coding outside of my day job, except for the odd experiment with Clojure or machine learning. It’s funny that I never showcased this kind of new knowledge before.

But things have changed. I’ve come to see GitHub as more than a tool — it’s a space to share curiosity, growth, and ideas. From now on, I plan to use it to showcase projects and experiments in the technologies I’m passionate about (even if I don’t use them at work). And, of course, I’ll be writing about what I learn along the way.
