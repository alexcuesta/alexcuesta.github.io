title: From Java Fatigue to Go and AI
---

I’ve grown a bit tired of the Java ecosystem. Nowadays, it often feels like we’re programming for Spring rather than the JVM. Spring, while powerful, tends to spoil developers by enforcing an overly opinionated way of building software—often adding unnecessary complexity where simpler, lightweight solutions would suffice.

The Java language itself has also become increasingly convoluted. In its effort to catch up with Kotlin, it’s evolving into a three-headed monster—introducing multiple ways of achieving the same thing, which ultimately makes team development more complicated instead of simplifying it.

That’s why, in recent months, I’ve become increasingly interested in **Go language** and **AI/LLMs**. I’d love to get involved in projects within these fields in the near future.

# Why Go?

Go, on the other hand, feels refreshing in its simplicity. Most of the essential tools come built-in—no need to juggle frameworks, build systems, or plugins like Spring, Maven, or Gradle. It offers a straightforward, pragmatic approach to software development that prioritises clarity and consistency over cleverness.

I followed the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1), completed a [Go course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/9e85825cfa3b72a6cb3690bec0770af2878327e514aa636f93e915559c867c25?accountId=190487953&u=190487953&success=true&authUUID=VZrWt4MHSKi3YVWwvMgMOg%3D%3D) and created some [projects](https://github.com/alexcuesta/go-weather) in the past. However, I want to start focusing more on this language since now on.


# Why Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models? 
  
Although I don’t have time to explore every new technology, I can’t help but feel passionate about innovation — especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models and Generative AI are truly astonishing, and they’ve completely reignited my curiosity.

I now dedicate time to keeping up with new developments, experimenting with different models and agents, and learning how to design more effective prompts. I’ve also been exploring how applications can integrate with LLMs and how their capabilities can be extended through MCP servers.

To put this curiosity into practice, I’ve built a couple of small projects:

* A [Python-based code review app](https://github.com/alexcuesta/code-review-app) powered by Ollama.
* An [MCP server in Node.js](https://github.com/alexcuesta/devcontext), to understand how tools can be exposed for agent interaction.

Additionally, I completed [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course in 2018](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/KDAEHMZ8P9WR), which gave me a solid foundation in the fundamentals of AI.
